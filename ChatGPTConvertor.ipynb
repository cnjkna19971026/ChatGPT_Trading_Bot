              "'(NHS) [ 36], aldehyde [ 37,38], and genipin [ 39] are widely used for\\ncross-linking gelatin-based scaffolds, such as sponges, nano ﬁbers, and\\ncapsules etc. However, the chemical cross-linking methods can be\\ncaused the cytotoxicity by residual unreacted cross-linking agents in\\nthe gelatin hydrogel [ 37,40]. Unlike the chemical cross-linking method,\\ndry heat treatment (DHT) is a physical cross-linking method that doesnot require chemical cross-linking agents [ 41,42]. The DHT method\\nremoves water molecules from the gelatin chain and forms intermolec-\\nular cross-links through the formation of amide bonds [ 43,44]. Thus\\nDHT method is advantageous for the absence of cytotoxicity problemsdue to residual chemical agents [ 45].\\nThis study optimizes the rheological properties of the gelatin solu-\\ntion for 3D bioprinting and evaluates the cross-linking method for di-\\nmensional stability. In a previous study, we fabricated pore size\\ncontrolled 3D gelatin scaffolds with two steps 3D bioprinting approach:\\na low-temperature ( −10 °C) freezing step and a chemical cross-linking\\nprocess using EDC/NHS. The pore sizes of the 3D gelatin scaffolds wereapproximately 30% smaller than those of the designed pore sizes.\\n3D gelatin scaffolds with high strand uniformity were prepared by\\nexamining the two factors of the 3D bioprinting parameters: concentra-\\ntion and temperature. The 3D printed gelatin scaffolds were then cross-\\nlinked using two types of cross-linking method: physical or chemical.\\nThe physicochemical properties of the gelatin scaffolds prepared using\\neither of the two cross-linking methods were then studied. The cell af-\\nﬁnities of the 3D scaffold prepared using the two cross-linking methods\\nwere tested by culturing human dermal ﬁbroblasts (HDFs) on each\\ncross-linked 3D scaffold. The cellular biological properties were then\\nevaluated.\\n2. Materials and methods2.1. Rheological measurements of the gelatin solution\\nGelatin (Bloom 300, type A, Sigma, USA) was dissolved in distilled\\nwater (DIW). The gelatin solution was prepared at three different con-\\ncentrations (3, 3.5, and 4% (w/v)) and four different temperatures (60,\\n70, 80, and 90 °C). The rheological properties of the aqueous gelatin so-\\nlutions were measured using an AR 2000ex rheometer (TA instruments,\\nUSA). All measurements were performed using the cone –plate geome-\\ntry (diameter 40 mm, angle 1°) to measure the storage modulus (G ′)\\nand loss modulus (G ″) in oscillatory tests conducted at temperatures\\nfrom 37 °C to 10 °C. The temperature was lowered at a rate of 1.0°C /min, and the oscillations were applied at a frequency of 1 Hz and a 1%strain. The gel point of gelatin is de ﬁned as the temperature at which\\nthe G ′value exceeds the G ″value during a temperature decrease [ 46].\\nAt that temperature, gelatin begins to solidify. Time sweep experiments\\nwere conducted over 1800 s at a ﬁxed temperature, 20 °C, strain, 1%, and\\nfrequency, 1 Hz. Frequency sweep experiments were conducted at aﬁxed strain of 1% from 0.1 to 10 Hz at 20 °C.\\n2.2. Fabrication of the 3D scaffolds\\nAs shown in Fig. 1 , we fabricated the 3D scaffolds using a 3D\\nbioprinter comprising a modi ﬁed commercial 3D printer by introducing\\na cryogenic system and pneumatic dispenser (ML-5000XII; MUSASHI,Japan). We designed the scaffold using CAD (Solidworks). The total 3D\\nscaffold size was ﬁxed at 12.5 × 12.5 × 3 mm\\n3(12 layers). The temper-\\nature of the cryogenic plate was kept at −10 °C to maintain the struc-\\nture during the 3D bioprinting process. Uninterrupted gelatin strands\\nwere obtained by moving the nozzle at a speed of 10 mm/s. The internal\\ntemperature of the bioprinter was maintained at 20 –22 °C. After trans-\\nferring 6 mL of an aqueous gelatin solution to a 10 mL syringe, the rub-ber plunger of the syringe was replaced with an PLF-E plunger\\n(MUSASHI, Japan) in order to apply a pneumatic pressure of100 –450 kPa to the syringe. Multiple layers and a porous 3D scaffold\\nwere obtained as each layer adhered to the previous layer to form a0°/90° strand structure. Immediately after 3D bioprinting, the 3D scaf-\\nfolds were transferred to a −80 °C deep freezer (MDF-U74V, SANYO,\\nJapan) and frozen overnight. And then, a 3D scaffolds were dried byfreeze-drying for 24 h. We con ﬁrmed the strand size and uniformity of\\nthe 3D scaffolds using scanning electron microscopy (SEM) (CX-200TM; COSEM, Korea). The dried 3D scaffolds were coated with gold\\nusing a digital ion coater and were characterized using SEM.\\n2.3. Cross-linking of the 3D scaffolds\\nPhysical and chemical cross-linking was carried out to maintain the\\nstructure of the 3D scaffolds. 1) Dried heat-treated (DHT) 3D scaffolds;\\nthe 3D scaffolds were heated in a vacuum oven (OV-11; JEIO TECH,\\nKorea) at a rate of 10 °C/h, elevated to 110 °C, held for 1, 3, 6, 12, and\\n24 h. The samples were then cooled slowly at 10 °C/h. 2) Chemically\\ntreated 3D scaffolds; EDC (Dae Jung, Korea)/NHS (Sigma, USA), as a\\ncross-linking agent, was dissolved in a 90% aqueous ethanol solution.\\nThe 3D scaffolds were placed in a 24-well plate, and an EDC/NHS\\nFig. 1.
